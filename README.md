## Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project demonstrates how to build a digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras.

### Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in digit recognition tasks. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with different network architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques.

### Visualization Explanations

#### Sample Images from the MNIST Dataset
- This visualization displays a grid of sample images from the MNIST dataset.
- Each image represents a handwritten digit ranging from 0 to 9.
- The images are grayscale and have been preprocessed for model training.

#### Training History
- The training history plot shows the change in training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.
- It helps in understanding the model's convergence and potential overfitting or underfitting issues.

#### Confusion Matrix
- The confusion matrix visualizes the model's classification performance.
- It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each digit class.
- Brighter colors indicate higher values, highlighting areas of frequent misclassification.

### Results
The CNN model achieved an accuracy of approximately 87% on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits. The confusion matrix reveals the model's classification performance across different digit classes.
